    "\n",
    "In class we looked at Gaussian copulas for pricing two-asset derivatives. We talked about using that model to price cross-pair options based on the two USD-pair option markets, calibrating the Gaussian copula correlation parameter such that the model reproduces the ATM cross option price.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do that, the model tends to underprice the butterfly – ie the implied volatility smile that comes out of the model is lower than the market. We said that was due to the fact that the model does not include any premium for stochastic correlation, which it should because correlation is not constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic correlation only affects the value of a derivative if its exposure to that correlation is non-linear. Let’s consider a specific case of the Gaussian copula to examine that: one where the RR and BF of the USD pairs is zero. In that case, their pricing is just Black-Scholes pricing, and if we assume a constant correlation, the pricing of the cross option is Black-Scholes with an implied volatility\n",

    "Calculate the “gamma” of the cross option price with respect to the correlation parameter . Assume a market where the two USD-pair spots are 1, interest rates are zero, time to expiration is 0.5y, the USD-pair volatilities are both equal to 10%, and the correlation is +25%, and plot the correlation gamma as a function of strike for the cross-pair options.\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important market dynamic for knockout out pricing is the risk reversal beta, and the most important for volatility swap pricing is the realized volatility of implied volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Knockout out pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "For knockouts, we can construct a hedge portfolio of vanilla options that is a “semi-static” hedge. If long a down-and-out knockout call, we can sell the regular call and buy a put whose strike is $\\frac{B_2}{K}$. That portfolio hedges almost all my market risk unless the barrier is hit – then I need to unwind it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of unwinding is mostly a function of risk reversal, because at that point the call and put are equally out-of-the-money. Their net sensitivity to ATM vol is small, which is sensitive only to the level of risk reversal. The expected level of risk reversal is how much risk reversal will have moved while spot moved to the barrier, which is our measure of risk reversal beta: the regression coefficient of moves in risk reversal with moves in spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Volatility swap pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "For vol swaps, the hedge for a long vol swap is a short variance swap. The vol swap looks like a square-root payoff against the variance swap, which is non-linear dependence. Keep rebalancing the notional of the short variance swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "You expect to lose money doing so, as it’s a short gamma position. You then expect to lose money over time running a long vol swap position, and you get compensated for that by being able to enter the vol swap at a fair strike that’s less than the square root of the variance swap fair strike.  The discount in fair strike depends on the realized volatility of the variance swap fair strike, which is roughly the same as realized volatility of implied volatility."
